## 📖 About

This project is a simple yet expressive personal website built to showcase my interests and creative side. It’s designed with minimalism and clarity in mind, offering visitors a clean and welcoming experience.

The layout and structure were inspired by templates from **Elzero Web School** (Osama Mohamed's channel), but customized with my own style and approach to reflect my personality.
